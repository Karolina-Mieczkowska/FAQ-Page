A significant factor is how far the language you study is from your native language group. Is this language Slavic, Germanic? Is it may be outside of the Indo-European group? Does this language is written in a different alphabet? But the most significant aspect is how much time you put into learning. There is no fast way. Everyone who learned any foreign language knows that it takes hundreds of hours and a few years of studying. That's why adequately selected, enjoyable technic of learning is so important.</div>

For example language family for the English language is "Germanic", and the descendants of this family are closely related to German, Dutch, Swedish and other Germanic languages. Language families create a family tree as one group forms a group with another. For example, Slavic languages with groups like Germanic or Baltic belong to Indo-European Family. Finno-Ugric languages, though, like Finnish, Hungarian and others belong to the Uralic family.</div>
